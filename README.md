# Python ML/AI/Data Project
This is a project aimed at collecting all the work I am doing to rebuild my skills in Python as well as relearn the AI, maths, and Data Science knowledge I haven't used in a while.

## Aims
My current aims and plans for this are as follow:
- Build a Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network from the following tutorial: https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/intro.html
- Build a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT) from the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY
- Build a Diffusion Model with PyTorch from the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBCRlnwJtZU
- Build a Neural Radiance Field with the following video to help me understand how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRlN-cYFxTk
